# 🚀 Facebook Friend Request Canceller (by PhCtrlZ)

A powerful automation tool that **cancels all sent friend requests** on Facebook automatically.  
Built with **Python**, using **Selenium** for browser automation and **PyQt5** for a clean graphical interface.

## 🧠 Overview

This tool helps you:
- Log into Facebook using a **cookie** (no username/password required).
- Navigate to the “Friend Requests” page automatically.
- Click on **“View Sent Requests”**.
- Cancel every sent friend request one by one.
- Pause, resume, or stop the process at any time.

The cancellation speed can be adjusted via a **delay timer** to avoid triggering Facebook’s anti-bot detection.
